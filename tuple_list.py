# Concept about Tuple and List

#Creating a List
list=[1,4,5,6,7,8]#Always use [] bracket to enclose
print("List:",list)

list[4]=54 # Adding 54 to the 4th index of list
print("New list:",list)



#Creating a tuple
tuple=(1,2,5,3,6)# Always use a ()bracket
print(tuple)
tuple[2]=23 #Adding 23 to  the 2nd index
print(tuple) #It will give error as adding the 
            #elements is not allowded
