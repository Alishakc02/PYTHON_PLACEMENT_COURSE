#Concept about Tuple and Dictionary

#Creating a tuple
tuple=(1,2,5,3,6)
# Always use a ()bracket
print(tuple)
tuple[2]=23 
#Adding 23 to  the 2nd index
print(tuple) 
#It will give error as adding the 
#elements is not allowded
            

#Creating a Dictionary

dict={
    "mo:mo":120,
    "pizza":200
}
print(dict)
